# GitHub Actions AWS CDK

GitHub Action for running the AWS CDK using the JVM.

This action runs commands using the AWS CDK, optimised for JVM languages.

See the [AWS CDK documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) for full
information on requirements and prerequisites for using the AWS CDK in your AWS
account.

## Credentials

The AWS CDK requires credentials to perform actions. You must use a separate
action to configure AWS credentials and make them available to this action via
environment variables.

We recommend using
the ["Configure AWS Credentials" Action for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/configure-aws-credentials-action-for-github-actions)
for handling credentials, as this supplies numerous secure ways of accessing
credentials, and automatically makes them available for this action to use.
